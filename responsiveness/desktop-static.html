    <div id="one">
        <h2>This is the red div</h2>
        <p>Here's a bunch of awesome information about the color red. Did you know that roses are red?</p>
    </div>
    <div id="two">
        <h2>This is the blue div</h2>
        <p>Blue is probably my favorite color. But not really this color of blue. I like it when it's a slightly darker shade.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="three">
        <h2>This is the green div</h2>
        <p>Green is the color of vegetables. Do with that what you will.</p>
    </div>
